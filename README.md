# Sqlite
A Qwasar project about implementation of major SQLite functions

This project is a recreation of the SQLite functions WHERE, FROM, SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE by reading the input content and carrying out certain functions.
CSV files "students.csv" and "nba_players.csv" are used to test the program, the commands are entered into the terminal and the terminal returns the expected data.
